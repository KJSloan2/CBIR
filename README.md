Currently all tools in this repo are in progress.
The current focus of these tools is to take a batch of images, analyze their characteristics and extract features that allow are used to represent the images in 3D space. Visualization tools with allow the user to interactively explore images. Further development will aim to extract insights from the images. ![image](https://github.com/KJSloan2/Image_Modeling/assets/61387934/5395f8d2-8bdf-4887-8ed7-e6a9493862d7)
